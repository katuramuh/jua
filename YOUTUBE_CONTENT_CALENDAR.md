# Jua Framework — YouTube Content Calendar (30 Days)

**Channel:** https://www.youtube.com/@JuaFramework
**Goal:** Awareness, SEO, practical course walkthroughs
**Format:** Under 10 minutes each, "coding along with me" style
**Schedule:** One video per day, 30 consecutive days
**Structure:** 19 courses (9 web + 5 desktop + 5 mobile), each split into 2-3 videos

---

## Content Strategy

### SEO Keywords (target in titles, descriptions, tags)
- Primary: jua framework, go react framework, full-stack go, go web framework
- Secondary: go crud generator, go jwt auth, go admin panel, go file upload s3, go background jobs
- Long-tail: "build saas with go", "go react monorepo", "wails desktop app", "expo react native go backend"
- Comparison: "go vs laravel", "gin vs next.js", "go react vs next.js full stack"

### Posting Schedule
- Upload daily at 9:00 AM UTC (consistent time builds algorithm trust)
- Publish Monday through Sunday, no gaps
- Pin a playlist "Jua Framework — Full Course" on the channel page
- Add end screens linking to the next video in the series

### Shorts Strategy
- Extract one 30-60 second clip from each video (the "hook" or a single impressive demo moment)
- Post each Short 4-6 hours after the main video goes live
- Title format for Shorts: "Build [X] in [Y] seconds with Jua" or "One command = [result]"
- Shorts drive discovery; long-form drives retention and subscribers

### Thumbnail Consistency Guidelines
- **Background:** Dark navy gradient (#0b1120 to #0a0a0f)
- **Primary text:** Bold white or sky blue (#38bdf8), max 4-5 words, positioned left or center
- **Secondary text:** Smaller, muted (#9090a8), bottom edge
- **Visual element:** Always include one of: terminal screenshot, code snippet, app screenshot, or architecture diagram on the right side
- **Accent glow:** Soft purple (#6c5ce7) or sky blue (#38bdf8) bloom behind the visual element
- **Course badge:** Small colored pill in top-left corner — "WEB 0", "WEB 1", "DESKTOP 3", etc. — color-coded per section (blue for web, green for desktop, orange for mobile)
- **No faces** in thumbnails — developer/code-focused aesthetic
- **Font:** Bold sans-serif (Inter Black or similar), always ALL CAPS for primary text
- **Resolution:** 1280x720, safe zone: keep text away from edges by 80px

## WEEK 1: JUA WEB — Introduction & Setup (Days 1-7)

---

### Day 1 — Course 0, Part 1: What is Jua?

**Title:** "The Setup Tax is Killing Your Projects — Jua Fixes It"
**Description:** Every Go project starts with the same grind: wiring auth, building an admin panel, setting up file storage, configuring Docker. Jua eliminates all of it.
