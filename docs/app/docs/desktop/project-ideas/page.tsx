              <p>
                All 20 projects share traits that make them ideal for native
                desktop apps built with Jua and Wails:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Offline-first</strong> &mdash; SQLite stores everything
                  locally. No cloud database, no internet dependency, no server
                  costs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Single binary</strong> &mdash; Distribute a single{" "}
                  <code>.exe</code> or <code>.app</code> file. Users
                  double-click to run. No installation wizard, no runtime
                  dependencies.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Data privacy</strong> &mdash; Sensitive data (medical
                  records, financial transactions, employee payroll) never
                  leaves the user&apos;s machine.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Fast generation</strong> &mdash; Each resource takes
                  one CLI command. A 5-resource project like the POS system is
                  fully scaffolded in under a minute.
                </li>
              </ul>

                That is 4 resources, 20 new files, 40 code injections, and a
                complete CRUD app — all from six CLI commands. Add custom

                generation) on top of the generated scaffolding.
