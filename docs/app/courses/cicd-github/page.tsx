          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Without CI/CD, shipping code looks like this: you write code, run tests manually (maybe),
            build the project, SSH into a server, pull the code, restart services, and pray nothing
            breaks. With CI/CD, you push code and everything else happens automatically.
          </p>

          <Definition term="CI (Continuous Integration)">
            Automatically testing code every time it{"'"}s pushed to the repository. Every push triggers
            a build and test suite. If tests fail, the team knows immediately — before the code reaches
            production. CI catches bugs early.
          </Definition>

          <Definition term="CD (Continuous Deployment)">
            Automatically deploying code after tests pass. When CI confirms the code is good, CD ships
            it to staging or production without manual intervention. No more SSH-and-pray deployments.
          </Definition>

          <Definition term="Pipeline">
            A series of automated steps that run in sequence: test, build, deploy. Each step must pass
            before the next one runs. If any step fails, the pipeline stops and notifies the team.
            Think of it as an assembly line for code.
          </Definition>

          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
            A typical CI/CD pipeline:

            Staging should mirror production as closely as possible — same OS, same database engine,
            same environment variables (with different values). If it works on staging, it should
            work in production.

          <Challenge number={8} title="Design Your Branching Strategy">
            <p>Design a branching strategy for your project. Which branch deploys where? How does
            code flow from feature to staging to production? Draw the flow: feature branch, then PR
            to staging, then test, then PR to main, then production deploy.</p>

            When CI fails at 2 AM, you want to know. When a deployment succeeds, the team should
            celebrate. Notifications close the feedback loop — the pipeline tells you what happened.

            <li className="flex gap-2"><span className="text-primary">•</span> <strong className="text-foreground">Test failure</strong> — urgent notification to Slack/Discord with the failing branch and commit</li>
            <li className="flex gap-2"><span className="text-primary">•</span> <strong className="text-foreground">Successful deploy</strong> — info notification: {'"'}v1.2.0 deployed to production{'"'}</li>

          </ul>

          <Tip>
            GitHub also sends email notifications by default. For teams, Slack or Discord webhooks
            are more visible. Everyone sees the notification in the team channel, not buried in
            individual inboxes.
          </Tip>

          <Challenge number={9} title="Plan Your Notifications">
            <p>What notifications would you want for these events? (1) Test failure on a PR,
            (2) Successful deploy to staging, (3) Successful deploy to production, (4) New GitHub
            Release created. For each, specify: who should be notified, how (Slack, email, Discord),
            and what the message should say.</p>
