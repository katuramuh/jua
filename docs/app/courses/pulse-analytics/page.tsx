            You cannot improve what you cannot measure. When your API is slow, which endpoint is the
            bottleneck? When memory usage spikes, what caused it? When errors happen in production,
            how do you find them? In this course, you will learn how Pulse — Jua{"'"}s built-in
            observability SDK — gives you complete visibility into your running application.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mb-4">What is Observability?</h2>

          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Observability is the ability to understand what your application is doing internally by
            examining its external outputs. In production, you cannot attach a debugger or add print
            statements. You need systems that continuously collect and present data about your
            application{"'"}s behavior.
          </p>

          <Definition term="Observability">
            The measure of how well you can understand a system{"'"}s internal state from its external
            outputs. A highly observable system lets you answer questions like {'"'}why is this endpoint
            slow?{'"'} or {'"'}what caused that error?{'"'} without deploying new code or restarting
            the application.
          </Definition>

          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Observability rests on three pillars:
          </p>

          <Definition term="Logs">
            Timestamped text records of events: {'"'}User 42 logged in at 10:03:22,{'"'} {'"'}Database
            query took 340ms,{'"'} {'"'}Error: connection refused.{'"'} Logs tell you WHAT happened.
            They are the most basic form of observability.
          </Definition>

          <Definition term="Metrics">
            Numerical measurements over time: request count, response time (p50, p95, p99), memory
            usage, CPU utilization, active database connections. Metrics tell you HOW MUCH is
            happening. They are cheap to collect and good for alerting.
          </Definition>

          <Definition term="Traces">
            End-to-end records of a single request as it flows through your system. A trace shows
            every step: the middleware, the handler, the database query, the external API call — with
            timing for each step. Traces tell you WHERE time is being spent.
          </Definition>

          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Most observability solutions (Datadog, New Relic, Grafana Cloud) are external services
            that cost money and send your data to third-party servers. Pulse is different — it{"'"}s
            built into your Jua application and runs locally. Your data stays with you.
          </p>

          <Challenge number={1} title="Three Pillars">
            <p>In your own words, explain the difference between logging, metrics, and tracing.
            Give a concrete example of when you would use each one. For instance: when would a
            log be more useful than a metric? When would a trace be more useful than a log?</p>

          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Pulse is Jua{"'"}s built-in observability SDK. It{"'"}s embedded directly in your API

            no API keys, no monthly bills — just start your Jua API and open the dashboard.

          </ul>

          <Tip>
            Pulse is designed for self-hosting. Your request data, error logs, and performance metrics
            never leave your infrastructure. This makes it suitable for applications with strict data
            residency requirements (GDPR, HIPAA) where sending telemetry to external services is not
            permitted.

            The dashboard displays this data in a table, sorted by most recent. You can filter by
            endpoint, status code, or time range. The most useful view is sorting by duration — this
            instantly reveals your slowest endpoints.

          <Note>
            A response time under 100ms is good. Under 50ms is excellent. If you see endpoints
            consistently over 200ms, they likely have inefficient database queries — the Database
            Monitoring section (next) will help you find them.
          </Note>

          <Challenge number={3} title="Find the Slowest Endpoint">
            <p>Make at least 20 requests to different endpoints in your API — use the Scalar docs,

          <Tip>
            Look for query patterns, not individual queries. If you see <Code>SELECT * FROM products

            A steadily increasing goroutine count that never decreases is a goroutine leak. This

            channel that is never closed, a lock that is never released). Pulse helps you spot
            these leaks by showing goroutine count over time.

            It stores the data as time series and provides a query language (PromQL) for analysis.

            To use this with Grafana, add a Prometheus data source pointing at

            request rate, error rate, response time percentiles, and resource usage.

            You do not need Prometheus and Grafana to use Pulse. The built-in dashboard at
            <Code> /pulse/ui</Code> covers most needs. The Prometheus endpoint is for teams that
            already have a monitoring stack and want to integrate Jua{"'"}s metrics into their
