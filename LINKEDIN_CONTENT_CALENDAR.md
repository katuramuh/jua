# Jua Framework — 30-Day LinkedIn Content Calendar

**Company Page**: https://www.linkedin.com/company/jua-framework
**Goal**: Awareness, developer engagement, drive traffic to docs/courses/YouTube.
**Posting cadence**: 1 post per day, 30 consecutive days.

## Day 1 — Introducing Jua Framework

**Theme**: Awareness

**Post Text**:

We built something we wish existed when we started building full-stack applications in Go.

Meet Jua Framework — a full-stack Go + React framework that scaffolds production-ready applications in seconds. Not a starter template. Not a boilerplate collection. A real CLI tool that generates structured, tested, deployable code.

Here is what happens when you run one command:

```bash
jua new myapp
```

You get a complete monorepo with:

- A Go API server (Gin + GORM) with JWT authentication and 2FA
- A React frontend (Next.js or TanStack Router) with Tailwind CSS
- An admin panel with data tables, form builders, and system pages
- File uploads via presigned URLs
- Background jobs with asynq
- Email sending with templates
- Database migrations and seeders
- One-command deployment to any VPS

That is 18 production features, configured and wired together, ready for you to build on top of.

We are not trying to replace your favorite tools. We are trying to eliminate the 2-3 weeks of setup that every serious project demands before you write your first feature.

Jua is open source, free, and built by developers who got tired of the setup tax.

**Gemini Image Prompt**: Create a professional LinkedIn post thumbnail (1200x627px) with a dark background (#0a0a0f). Show the Jua Framework logo in purple (#6c5ce7) on the left side. On the right, display a terminal window with the command "jua new myapp" and green success output lines. Include the tagline "Full-Stack Go + React Framework" in white text at the bottom. Clean, modern, developer-focused design.

## Day 2 — The Setup Tax

**Theme**: Pain Point

**Post Text**:

Every full-stack project starts the same way.

Day 1: Set up the Go module structure. Configure the router. Add middleware.
Day 2: Wire up the database. Write migration scripts. Set up GORM models.
Day 3: Build JWT authentication. Add password hashing. Create login and register endpoints.
Day 4: Set up the React project. Configure Tailwind. Create the layout components.
Day 5: Build the admin panel. Add data tables. Create form components.
Day 6-7: File uploads. Background jobs. Email sending. Environment config.
Day 8-10: Wire the frontend to the backend. Handle auth state. Add protected routes.

That is two weeks of work before you write a single line of business logic. We call this the Setup Tax, and every developer pays it on every project.

The worst part? This work is almost identical across projects. You are solving the same problems, in the same way, every single time.

Some teams maintain internal boilerplate repos. These go stale within months. Dependencies drift. Patterns become outdated. Nobody wants to maintain them.

What if the setup was automated, kept current, and followed proven conventions?

That is the problem Jua Framework solves. One command generates the complete foundation. You skip straight to building what makes your application unique.

Your time should be spent on features, not on plumbing.

https://juaframework.dev/courses/jua-web/introduction

**Gemini Image Prompt**: Create a professional LinkedIn post thumbnail (1200x627px) with a dark background. On the left side, show a calendar with days 1-14 crossed out in red (#ff6b6b), representing wasted setup time. On the right, show a single terminal command "jua new myapp" with a green checkmark (#00b894). Include the text "Stop Paying the Setup Tax" in bold white text. Minimal, clean design with purple (#6c5ce7) accent elements.

## Day 3 — 5 Architecture Modes

**Theme**: Unique Feature

**Post Text**:

Not every project needs the same structure. A SaaS dashboard has different requirements than a mobile app backend.

This is why Jua Framework ships with 5 architecture modes:

1. Triple (Monorepo) — Go API + Next.js/TanStack frontend + Admin panel. The full stack for SaaS products, marketplaces, and complex web applications.

2. Double — Go API + one frontend. Perfect when you need a public-facing site without a separate admin interface, or when you are building an internal tool.

3. Single — Go API only with server-rendered templates. Lightweight, fast, ideal for content sites and simple CRUD applications.

4. API — Pure Go backend with no frontend at all. Built for microservices, webhook handlers, and backends that serve mobile or third-party clients.

5. Mobile — Go API + Expo React Native app. One command gives you a complete mobile development environment with shared types and API client.

Each mode generates only the code you need. No dead imports. No unused packages. No configuration for features you will never use.

The architecture selection happens interactively during project creation:

```bash
jua new myapp
# Select architecture: Triple / Double / Single / API / Mobile
# Select frontend: Next.js / TanStack Router
```

Your project structure should match your project requirements. Not the other way around.

https://juaframework.dev/docs/concepts/architecture-modes

**Gemini Image Prompt**: Create a professional LinkedIn post thumbnail (1200x627px) with a dark background (#0a0a0f). Display 5 architecture diagrams arranged horizontally: Triple (3 boxes stacked), Double (2 boxes), Single (1 box), API (server icon), Mobile (phone icon). Each diagram uses purple (#6c5ce7) outlines with white labels beneath. Title text "5 Architecture Modes" in bold white at the top. Clean, technical, diagram-style design.

## Day 4 — jua new myapp in Action

**Theme**: Demo

**Post Text**:

Here is what it looks like to create a full-stack application with Jua Framework.

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
jua new myapp
```

The interactive CLI walks you through your choices:

```
? Select architecture mode:
  > Triple (API + Frontend + Admin)
    Double (API + Frontend)
    Single (API only with templates)
    API (Pure backend)
    Mobile (API + React Native)

? Select frontend framework:
  > Next.js
    TanStack Router

? Select database:
  > PostgreSQL
    SQLite

? Enable 2FA authentication? Yes
? Enable file uploads? Yes
? Enable background jobs? Yes
```

In under 30 seconds, Jua generates your entire project:

```
Created myapp/
  apps/api/          — Go API server
  apps/web/          — React frontend
  apps/admin/        — Admin panel
  packages/shared/   — Shared types

Installing dependencies...
Running initial migration...

Your project is ready.
  cd myapp && jua dev
```

Run `jua dev` and you have a working application with authentication, an admin dashboard, file uploads, and background job processing — all configured, all connected.

Every generated file is yours. No hidden abstractions. No framework lock-in. Just clean, readable Go and TypeScript that you can modify however you need.

Try it yourself:

```bash
go install github.com/katuramuh/jua@latest
jua new myapp
```

https://juaframework.dev/docs/getting-started/quick-start

**Gemini Image Prompt**: Create a professional LinkedIn post thumbnail (1200x627px) showing a realistic terminal/command-line interface on a dark background. The terminal displays "jua new myapp" at the top with colorful interactive menu options below it (architecture selection in purple #6c5ce7, green #00b894 checkmarks for completed steps). Include "From Zero to Full-Stack in 30 Seconds" as subtitle text in white. Modern, clean terminal aesthetic.

## Day 5 — Next.js vs TanStack Router

**Theme**: Comparison

**Post Text**:

When you create a Jua project, you choose between two frontend frameworks. Here is how to decide.

Next.js — Choose this when you need:
- Server-side rendering (SSR) for SEO
- Static site generation for marketing pages
- Image optimization out of the box
- A massive ecosystem of plugins and examples
- Server Actions for simple data mutations

Best for: Public-facing websites, content-heavy platforms, e-commerce, marketing sites.

TanStack Router — Choose this when you need:
- A pure single-page application (SPA)
- Type-safe routing with full TypeScript inference
- Client-side data fetching with TanStack Query
- Faster development iteration (no server compilation)
- Complete separation between frontend and API

Best for: Dashboards, internal tools, admin panels, applications behind authentication.

Both options in Jua come with:
- Pre-configured authentication flows
- API client with typed endpoints
- Tailwind CSS with the Jua theme
- Shared TypeScript types from the Go API
- Protected route wrappers

The honest answer? For most SaaS applications, TanStack Router is the better choice. Your frontend lives behind a login page. You do not need SSR. You want the fastest possible development feedback loop.

For public-facing products where Google needs to index your content, Next.js is the clear winner.

Jua supports both. You pick what fits.

https://juaframework.dev/courses/jua-web/first-app

**Gemini Image Prompt**: Create a professional LinkedIn post thumbnail (1200x627px) with a dark background. Show two columns: left column with Next.js logo and key benefits (SSR, SEO, Static) in blue tones, right column with TanStack Router logo and key benefits (SPA, Type-safe, Fast) in orange/red tones. A "VS" badge in purple (#6c5ce7) centered between them. Title "Next.js vs TanStack Router" in white at the top. Clean comparison layout.

## Day 6 — Code Generator in Action

**Theme**: Feature

**Post Text**:

Writing CRUD boilerplate is the least interesting part of software development. Let the machine do it.

Jua's code generator creates complete resources from a single command:

```bash
jua generate resource product \
  --fields "name:string,price:float,description:text,sku:string,active:bool"
```

That one command generates:

In your Go API:
- GORM model with proper types and JSON tags
- Migration file with timestamps
- Repository with Create, GetAll, GetByID, Update, Delete
- Service layer with business logic hooks
- HTTP handlers with request validation
- Routes registered automatically

In your Admin Panel:
- List page with DataTable (search, sort, paginate)
- Create page with FormBuilder
- Edit page with pre-populated fields
- Delete confirmation dialog
- Sidebar navigation entry

Every generated file follows the same conventions as the rest of your project. The code reads like you wrote it by hand.

Need relationships? The generator handles those too:

```bash
jua generate resource order \
  --fields "total:float,status:string" \
  --belongs-to "user" \
  --has-many "order_items"
```

The generated code is not hidden behind abstractions. It is real Go structs, real React components, real SQL migrations. You can read it, modify it, and learn from it.

Stop writing CRUD by hand.

https://juaframework.dev/courses/jua-web/code-generator

**Gemini Image Prompt**: Create a professional LinkedIn post thumbnail (1200x627px) with a dark background (#0a0a0f). Show a split view: on the left, a terminal with the "jua generate resource" command. On the right, show a file tree expanding with generated files (model.go, handler.go, service.go, ListPage.tsx, CreatePage.tsx) with green (#00b894) plus icons. Title "Generate Full CRUD in Seconds" in white. Purple (#6c5ce7) accent lines connecting the command to the generated files.

## Day 7 — What Ships with Every Jua Project

**Theme**: List

**Post Text**:

People ask us what comes included when you run `jua new`. Here is the complete list.

Every Jua project ships with 18 production features:

1. JWT Authentication — Access and refresh tokens, secure by default
2. Two-Factor Authentication — TOTP-based 2FA with QR code setup
3. Role-Based Access Control — Admin, editor, user roles with middleware
4. Admin Panel — DataTable, FormBuilder, 4 style variants, system pages
5. File Uploads — Presigned URL uploads to S3-compatible storage
6. Background Jobs — asynq-powered job queue with Redis
7. Email Sending — Template-based emails with SMTP support
8. Database Migrations — Version-controlled schema changes
9. Database Seeding — Populate development and production data
10. API Validation — Request validation with clear error messages
11. CORS Configuration — Pre-configured for your frontend origins
12. Environment Config — .env-based configuration with type safety
13. Error Handling — Consistent error responses across the API
14. Logging — Structured logging with request tracing
15. Pagination — Cursor and offset pagination on all list endpoints
16. Search — Full-text search on any resource field
17. Soft Deletes — Recoverable deletions on all models
18. One-Command Deploy — `jua deploy` to any VPS with Docker

You do not install these as plugins. You do not configure them from documentation. They are generated as part of your project, fully integrated, tested, and ready to use.

Every feature is real code in your repository. No black boxes. No magic. Just clean Go and TypeScript that you own and control.

https://juaframework.dev/

**Gemini Image Prompt**: Create a professional LinkedIn post thumbnail (1200x627px) with a dark background (#0a0a0f). Display a grid of 18 small icons representing each feature (lock for auth, shield for 2FA, users for RBAC, table for admin, cloud for uploads, gear for jobs, envelope for email, database for migrations, etc.) arranged in a 6x3 grid with purple (#6c5ce7) icon color. Title "18 Features. One Command." in bold white text at the top. Clean, icon-grid design.

## Day 8 — JWT + 2FA by Default

**Theme**: Security

**Post Text**:

Most frameworks treat authentication as an afterthought. Add a plugin. Follow a tutorial. Wire it up yourself. Hope you did not miss a security vulnerability.

Jua takes a different approach. Every project ships with production-grade authentication from the first command.

Here is what the generated auth system includes:

JWT with refresh tokens:
```go
// Generated in your project
func (s *AuthService) Login(email, password string) (*TokenPair, error) {
    user, err := s.repo.FindByEmail(email)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, ErrInvalidCredentials
    }
    if err := bcrypt.CompareHashAndPassword(
        []byte(user.Password), []byte(password),
    ); err != nil {
        return nil, ErrInvalidCredentials
    }
    if user.TwoFactorEnabled {
        return &TokenPair{RequiresTwoFactor: true}, nil
    }
    return s.generateTokenPair(user)
}
```

Two-Factor Authentication with TOTP:
- QR code generation for authenticator apps
- Backup codes for account recovery
- Enforced on sensitive operations
- Admin can require 2FA for all users

Password security:
- bcrypt hashing with configurable cost
- Password strength validation
- Brute-force protection with rate limiting

Session management:
- Refresh token rotation
- Token revocation on logout
- Configurable expiration times

Most Go projects ship authentication as a "getting started" exercise. In Jua, it is a solved problem. You focus on what your users can do after they log in.

https://juaframework.dev/courses/jua-web/authentication

**Gemini Image Prompt**: Create a professional LinkedIn post thumbnail (1200x627px) with a dark background. Center a large shield icon in purple (#6c5ce7) with a lock symbol inside. Surround it with smaller icons representing JWT tokens, 2FA codes, password hashing, and rate limiting in green (#00b894) accent. Title "Authentication, Solved" in bold white text. Subtitle "JWT + 2FA + Rate Limiting, Built In" in lighter text. Security-focused, professional design.

## Day 9 — The Admin Panel Showcase

**Theme**: Visual

**Post Text**:

Every serious application needs an admin panel. But building one from scratch takes days, sometimes weeks.

Jua generates a complete admin panel with every project. Here is what you get.

DataTable Component:
- Server-side pagination, sorting, and filtering
- Column visibility toggles
- Bulk actions (delete, export)
- Inline search across all fields
- Responsive design that works on mobile

FormBuilder Component:
- Renders forms from field configuration
- Text, number, select, textarea, date, file upload fields
- Client-side and server-side validation
- Loading states and error handling
- Handles create and edit modes automatically

4 Admin Style Variants:
- Default — Clean sidebar with collapsible sections
- Compact — Dense layout for data-heavy applications
- Modern — Card-based design with rounded corners
- Minimal — Stripped-down interface for simple projects

System Pages (pre-built):
- Dashboard with key metrics
- User management (list, create, edit, roles)
- Settings page with environment configuration
- Activity logs with filtering

When you run `jua generate resource`, the admin pages for that resource are created automatically. List view, create form, edit form, delete confirmation — all wired to your API endpoints.

The admin panel is not a separate package. It is generated TypeScript and React code in your repository. Customize anything.

https://juaframework.dev/courses/jua-web/admin-panel

**Gemini Image Prompt**: Create a professional LinkedIn post thumbnail (1200x627px) showing a mockup of a modern admin dashboard on a dark background (#0a0a0f). The dashboard should display a sidebar navigation in dark (#22222e), a data table with rows and columns, action buttons in purple (#6c5ce7), and metric cards at the top with green (#00b894) numbers. Title "Admin Panel, Generated" in white text overlay. Clean, UI-focused screenshot-style design.

## Day 10 — Jua vs Laravel

**Theme**: Comparison

**Post Text**:

If you are a Laravel developer considering Go, this comparison is for you.

What feels similar:
- `jua new` is like `laravel new` — one command, full project
- `jua generate resource` is like `php artisan make:model -mcr`
- `jua deploy` is like Laravel Forge — deployment in one command
- Migrations, seeders, middleware, service layers — same concepts
- Convention over configuration philosophy — sensible defaults

What is different:
- Go compiles to a single binary. No PHP-FPM, no Nginx configuration, no Composer on the server.
- Type safety at compile time. No runtime "undefined variable" errors in production.
- Concurrency is native. Goroutines handle thousands of concurrent connections without external tools.
- Memory usage is 10-50x lower. A Go API server runs comfortably on a $5 VPS.
- Frontend is React with TypeScript. Not Blade templates. Full component ecosystem.

What you might miss:
- Eloquent's expressive query syntax (GORM is powerful but more verbose)
- Laravel's massive package ecosystem (Go's ecosystem is smaller but growing)
- Blade components for simple server-rendered pages
- The PHP ecosystem's hosting ubiquity

The honest take: If you are building a content site or a simple CRUD application, Laravel is still excellent. If you are building a SaaS product, a high-traffic API, or anything where performance and type safety matter, Go with Jua gives you Laravel's developer experience with Go's runtime performance.

You do not have to choose blindly. Use what fits your project.

https://juaframework.dev/

**Gemini Image Prompt**: Create a professional LinkedIn post thumbnail (1200x627px) with a dark background. Show two sides: left side with the Go gopher mascot and "Jua Framework" text in purple (#6c5ce7), right side with the Laravel logo in red. Center divider with "vs" text. Below each logo, list 3 key strengths in small white text. Title "Laravel Developer? Considering Go?" at the top in white. Professional comparison layout, not adversarial.

## Day 11 — Presigned URL Uploads

**Theme**: Technical Tip

**Post Text**:

Here is a common mistake in web applications: routing file uploads through your API server.

The typical flow looks like this:
1. Client sends a file to your API
2. API receives the entire file into memory
3. API forwards the file to S3 or cloud storage
4. API responds to the client

The problem? Your API server becomes a bottleneck. A 100MB video upload consumes 100MB of server memory. Ten concurrent uploads and your server is struggling. This does not scale.

The correct approach is presigned URLs, and every Jua project uses them by default.

Here is how it works:

```go
// Generated in your Jua project
func (s *StorageService) GeneratePresignedURL(
    filename string,
    contentType string,
) (*PresignedResponse, error) {
    key := fmt.Sprintf("uploads/%s/%s",
        time.Now().Format("2006/01/02"),
        filename,
    )
    url, err := s.s3Client.PresignPutObject(
        context.Background(),
        &s3.PutObjectInput{
            Bucket:      &s.bucket,
            Key:         &key,
            ContentType: &contentType,
        },
        s3.WithPresignExpires(15*time.Minute),
    )
    return &PresignedResponse{
        UploadURL: url.URL,
        FileKey:   key,
    }, err
}
```

The improved flow:
1. Client asks your API for a presigned URL (tiny request)
2. API generates a temporary upload URL from S3
3. Client uploads directly to S3 (your server does zero work)
4. Client sends the file key back to your API to associate with a record

Your API server never touches the file. It handles a 200-byte JSON request instead of a 100MB file. This scales to thousands of concurrent uploads without breaking a sweat.

Jua generates this entire flow — backend endpoint, frontend upload component, and S3 configuration.

https://juaframework.dev/courses/jua-web/file-storage

**Gemini Image Prompt**: Create a professional LinkedIn post thumbnail (1200x627px) with a dark background (#0a0a0f). Show two flow diagrams: top diagram (crossed out in red #ff6b6b) showing Client -> API Server -> S3 with a large file icon. Bottom diagram (highlighted in green #00b894) showing Client -> S3 directly with a small arrow from Client to API for the presigned URL. Title "Stop Routing Uploads Through Your Server" in white. Clean technical diagram style with purple (#6c5ce7) accents.

## Day 12 — Background Jobs with asynq

**Theme**: Code Snippet

**Post Text**:

Some operations should not happen during an HTTP request. Sending emails, processing images, generating reports — these should run in the background.

Every Jua project includes a job queue powered by asynq and Redis. Here is how you use it.

Define a job:

```go
// tasks/send_welcome_email.go
const TypeSendWelcomeEmail = "email:welcome"

type SendWelcomeEmailPayload struct {
    UserID uint   `json:"user_id"`
    Email  string `json:"email"`
    Name   string `json:"name"`
}

func HandleSendWelcomeEmail(
    ctx context.Context,
    t *asynq.Task,
) error {
    var payload SendWelcomeEmailPayload
    if err := json.Unmarshal(t.Payload(), &payload); err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("unmarshal payload: %w", err)
    }

    return emailService.SendTemplate(
        payload.Email,
        "Welcome to the platform",
        "welcome",
        map[string]string{"name": payload.Name},
    )
}
```

Dispatch it from anywhere:

```go
// In your auth service, after registration
payload, _ := json.Marshal(SendWelcomeEmailPayload{
    UserID: user.ID,
    Email:  user.Email,
    Name:   user.Name,
})
task := asynq.NewTask(TypeSendWelcomeEmail, payload)
client.Enqueue(task, asynq.MaxRetry(3))
```

The job runs in a separate worker process. If it fails, asynq retries it automatically. Your API responds instantly while the email sends in the background.

Jua generates the worker setup, task registration, and Redis configuration. You just define your jobs and dispatch them.

https://juaframework.dev/courses/jua-web/jobs-email

**Gemini Image Prompt**: Create a professional LinkedIn post thumbnail (1200x627px) with a dark background (#0a0a0f). Show a flow diagram: HTTP Request box on the left connects to an API Server box in the center, which dispatches to a Redis Queue (red logo), which connects to a Worker Process box on the right processing tasks (email icon, image icon, report icon). Arrows show the async flow. Title "Background Jobs in Go" in white. Purple (#6c5ce7) and green (#00b894) accents.

## Day 13 — One-Command Deployment

**Theme**: Feature

**Post Text**:

Deployment should not require a DevOps certification.

Most Go projects end up with a 200-line Dockerfile, a docker-compose.yml, an Nginx config, SSL certificate setup, and a deployment script held together with hope.

Jua reduces this to one command:

```bash
jua deploy --host user@server.com --domain myapp.com
```

Here is what happens behind the scenes:

1. Builds your Go API into a single binary
2. Bundles your React frontend as static assets
3. Creates an optimized Docker image (multi-stage build, ~30MB)
4. Provisions your server with Docker and Docker Compose
5. Configures Nginx as a reverse proxy
6. Sets up Let's Encrypt SSL certificates (auto-renewal)
7. Deploys your application with zero-downtime
8. Configures PostgreSQL and Redis on the server
9. Runs database migrations automatically
10. Sets up log rotation and health checks

Requirements: A VPS with SSH access. That is it. A $5 DigitalOcean droplet, a Hetzner server, any machine with Ubuntu.

Subsequent deployments are even simpler:

```bash
jua deploy
```

It remembers your configuration and deploys only the changes.

No Kubernetes. No Terraform. No CI/CD pipeline configuration. Just your code, on a server, serving users.

When your application outgrows a single server, you can migrate to any orchestration platform. The generated Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml are standard — nothing Jua-specific.

https://juaframework.dev/courses/jua-web/deploy

**Gemini Image Prompt**: Create a professional LinkedIn post thumbnail (1200x627px) with a dark background (#0a0a0f). Show a laptop on the left with a terminal displaying "jua deploy" and a server rack on the right with a green (#00b894) status light. A purple (#6c5ce7) arrow connects them with icons along the path: Docker whale, lock (SSL), database cylinder, gear (Nginx). Title "Deploy to Production in One Command" in white. Clean, infrastructure-themed design.

## Day 14 — Vercel AI Gateway Integration

**Theme**: Trending Topic

**Post Text**:

Adding AI features to your application usually means:
- Picking a provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral...)
- Managing API keys for each provider
- Learning each provider's SDK
- Handling rate limits and failover
- Rewriting code when you want to switch models

Jua projects integrate with Vercel's AI Gateway, which solves all of this with a single API endpoint.

One API key. Hundreds of models. Here is what it looks like in a Jua project:

```go
// Generated AI service
func (s *AIService) Complete(
    prompt string,
    opts ...AIOption,
) (string, error) {
    config := defaultConfig()
    for _, opt := range opts {
        opt(config)
    }

    resp, err := s.gateway.CreateCompletion(
        context.Background(),
        &ai.CompletionRequest{
            Model:  config.Model, // "gpt-4o", "claude-3", etc.
            Prompt: prompt,
            MaxTokens: config.MaxTokens,
        },
    )
    return resp.Text, err
}
```

Switch models by changing a string. No SDK changes. No code rewrites.

Use cases that ship with Jua's AI integration:
- Content generation for admin panels
- Smart search with semantic understanding
- Automated email subject line suggestions
- Data summarization for dashboards

The AI features are optional. Enable them during project creation and the service layer, API endpoints, and frontend components are generated for you.

AI is becoming table stakes. Your framework should make it easy to add.

https://juaframework.dev/courses/jua-web/ai-features

## Day 16 — Desktop Apps with Go

**Theme**: Unique Feature

**Post Text**:

Most people think of Go as a backend language. But what if you could build native desktop applications with the same stack?

Jua's desktop scaffold creates standalone desktop apps using Wails v2:

```bash
jua new-desktop myapp
```

You get a native application with:
- Go backend with full system access
- React + TypeScript + Tailwind frontend
- SQLite or PostgreSQL for local data storage
- Native window controls (frameless, draggable)
- Local authentication with bcrypt
- Blog and contact CRUD as starter modules
- PDF and Excel export functionality
- System tray integration

The generated code is clean and understandable:

```go
// app.go — Methods bound to the frontend
func (a *App) GetAllBlogs() ([]models.Blog, error) {
    return a.blogService.GetAll()
}

func (a *App) ExportToPDF(data []byte) error {
    return a.exportService.GeneratePDF(data)
}
```

Your React frontend calls Go functions directly — no HTTP requests, no REST API, no WebSocket layer. Wails generates TypeScript bindings automatically.

The result is a native application that:
- Starts instantly (no browser to launch)
- Uses minimal memory (not Electron)
- Has full filesystem access
- Works offline by default
- Distributes as a single executable

Desktop development does not have to mean learning a new language or framework. If you know Go and React, you already know how to build desktop apps with Jua.

https://juaframework.dev/courses/jua-desktop

**Gemini Image Prompt**: Create a professional LinkedIn post thumbnail (1200x627px) with a dark background (#0a0a0f). Show a mockup of a native desktop application window with a dark frameless design, sidebar navigation, and a data table in the main area. The window has custom title bar controls. Wails logo and Go gopher in the corner. Title "Native Desktop Apps with Go + React" in white. Purple (#6c5ce7) accent on the window title bar. Professional application mockup design.

## Day 17 — The Tech Stack Explained

**Theme**: Educational

**Post Text**:

Every technology in the Jua stack was chosen deliberately. Here is why.

Go (Gin framework): Fast compilation, single binary deployment, excellent concurrency. Gin is the most popular Go web framework with minimal overhead and a massive middleware ecosystem.

GORM: The most widely adopted Go ORM. Auto-migrations, associations, hooks, and a query builder that covers 95% of use cases. Raw SQL when you need the other 5%.

React: The largest frontend ecosystem. The most job postings. The most component libraries. When your team hires a frontend developer, they probably know React.

TypeScript: Catches bugs before they reach production. When combined with generated types from your Go API, you get end-to-end type safety.

Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS that eliminates stylesheet bloat. Combined with shadcn/ui-style components, you get a consistent design system without fighting CSS specificity.

PostgreSQL: The most capable open-source database. JSON columns, full-text search, CTEs, and rock-solid reliability. SQLite is available for simpler projects.

Redis: In-memory data store for background job queues, caching, and session management. Fast, proven, and simple to operate.

asynq: Go-native background job library built on Redis. Typed payloads, automatic retries, dead letter queues, and a monitoring dashboard.

Docker: Consistent builds across environments. Multi-stage builds keep images small. Compose orchestrates API, database, and Redis together.

No experimental technology. No framework that launched last month. Every piece of this stack has years of production usage, active maintenance, and a large community.

Boring technology that works. That is the Jua philosophy.

https://juaframework.dev/courses/jua-web/introduction

**Gemini Image Prompt**: Create a professional LinkedIn post thumbnail (1200x627px) with a dark background (#0a0a0f). Display a horizontal tech stack diagram showing logos/icons for Go, Gin, GORM, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Docker arranged in a clean row or arc. Each logo has its name beneath it in small white text. Title "The Jua Stack — Every Choice Explained" in white at the top. Purple (#6c5ce7) connecting lines between the logos. Technical, professional design.

## Day 18 — jua routes Command

**Theme**: Quick Tip

**Post Text**:

Quick tip: Ever lose track of all the API endpoints in your project?

Run this:

```bash
jua routes
```

You get a formatted table of every registered route:

```
METHOD   PATH                          HANDLER
──────   ────                          ───────
POST     /api/auth/login               AuthHandler.Login
POST     /api/auth/register            AuthHandler.Register
POST     /api/auth/refresh             AuthHandler.RefreshToken
POST     /api/auth/2fa/verify          AuthHandler.VerifyTwoFactor
GET      /api/users                    UserHandler.GetAll
GET      /api/users/:id                UserHandler.GetByID
PUT      /api/users/:id                UserHandler.Update
DELETE   /api/users/:id                UserHandler.Delete
GET      /api/products                 ProductHandler.GetAll
GET      /api/products/:id             ProductHandler.GetByID
POST     /api/products                 ProductHandler.Create
PUT      /api/products/:id             ProductHandler.Update
DELETE   /api/products/:id             ProductHandler.Delete
POST     /api/storage/presign          StorageHandler.GenerateURL
GET      /api/health                   HealthHandler.Check
```

Filtered by method:

```bash
jua routes --method POST
```

Filtered by path prefix:

```bash
jua routes --prefix /api/products
```

This is especially useful when onboarding new team members or debugging frontend API calls. No need to dig through router configuration files.

Small tools that save minutes every day.

https://juaframework.dev/docs/concepts/cli

**Gemini Image Prompt**: Create a professional LinkedIn post thumbnail (1200x627px) with a dark background (#0a0a0f). Show a terminal window displaying the "jua routes" command output as a formatted table with colored HTTP methods (GET in green #00b894, POST in purple #6c5ce7, PUT in yellow, DELETE in red #ff6b6b).

## Day 19 — GORM Studio

**Theme**: Tool Showcase

**Post Text**:

Looking at database records through psql or a SQL client works. But it is not fun.

Every Jua project includes GORM Studio — a visual database browser that runs inside your development environment.

Start your development server:

```bash
jua dev
```

Open your browser to `localhost:8080/studio` and you get:

A table browser:
- See all your database tables at a glance
- Click any table to view its records
- Sort by any column, search across all fields
- View relationships between records

A record editor:
- Click any row to view its full details
- Edit values directly in the browser
- Create new records with a form interface
- Delete records with confirmation

A query runner:
- Write raw SQL queries
- View results in a formatted table
- Save frequently used queries
- Export results to CSV

Why this matters for development:

When you run `jua generate resource product`, you want to immediately see the table, insert test data, and verify relationships. GORM Studio lets you do this without switching to a separate database tool.

It is not a production tool. It is disabled outside of development mode. It is purely a development convenience that saves you from context-switching between your IDE, terminal, and database client.

Small things that make development more enjoyable.

https://juaframework.dev/docs/infrastructure/database

**Gemini Image Prompt**: Create a professional LinkedIn post thumbnail (1200x627px) with a dark background (#0a0a0f). Show a mockup of a database browser interface: left sidebar with table names (users, products, orders), main area showing a data table with rows and columns, and an edit panel on the right. Use purple (#6c5ce7) for selected/active elements and green (#00b894) for success states. Title "Visual Database Browser, Built In" in white. Clean UI mockup design.

## Day 20 — Community Poll

**Theme**: Engagement

**Post Text**:

We are building tools that solve real developer pain points. So we want to know yours.

What is your biggest time sink when building full-stack applications?

A) Authentication and user management
Setting up JWT, password reset, 2FA, roles, session management. Every. Single. Project.

B) Admin panel and CRUD interfaces
Building data tables, forms, list views, edit pages. The same patterns repeated for every resource.

C) Deployment and infrastructure
Dockerfiles, Nginx configs, SSL certificates, CI/CD pipelines, environment management.

D) Type safety between frontend and backend
Keeping API contracts in sync, duplicating types, debugging mismatched payloads.

E) Something else entirely
Tell us in the comments. We read every response.

Here is why we are asking: the features we build next are directly influenced by what developers actually struggle with. Not what we think is cool. Not what is trending on Hacker News. What wastes your time.

Every answer shapes the Jua roadmap.

Drop your answer in the comments or vote on the poll. Bonus points if you share a specific example of a project where this pain point cost you significant time.

(No link for this post — this is about listening.)

**Gemini Image Prompt**: Create a professional LinkedIn post thumbnail (1200x627px) with a dark background (#0a0a0f).

## Day 21 — 10 Official Plugins

**Theme**: Ecosystem

**Post Text**:

Jua ships with 18 built-in features. But some projects need more.

That is where Jua plugins come in. Install with one command, fully integrated with your project structure.

Here are the 10 official plugins:

1. WebSockets — Real-time communication with rooms, presence, and typed events. Built on gorilla/websocket.

2. Stripe — Subscription billing, one-time payments, customer portal, webhook handling. Generates models, services, and frontend components.

3. Video — Video upload, transcoding, and streaming. HLS adaptive bitrate. Thumbnail generation.

4. Search — Full-text search powered by Meilisearch. Auto-indexes your resources. Instant search UI component.

5. Notifications — In-app notifications with real-time delivery, read/unread tracking, and notification preferences.

6. Analytics — Event tracking, page views, user sessions. Privacy-friendly dashboard without third-party scripts.

7. Multi-tenancy — Organization-based data isolation. Subdomain routing. Per-tenant configuration.

8. Audit Log — Track every data change. Who changed what, when, and the before/after values.

9. Localization — i18n for your API responses and frontend. Language detection, translation files, locale switching.

10. Social Auth — OAuth2 login with Google, GitHub, Discord, and more. Extends the built-in auth system.

Each plugin follows the same conventions as generated code. Same file structure. Same patterns. Same quality.

```bash
jua plugin add stripe
jua plugin add websockets
```

The plugin system generates code, not dependencies. Once installed, the code is yours to modify.

https://juaframework.dev/docs/plugins

**Gemini Image Prompt**: Create a professional LinkedIn post thumbnail (1200x627px) with a dark background (#0a0a0f). Display a 2x5 grid of plugin cards, each with an icon and name: WebSockets (signal icon), Stripe (payment icon), Video (play icon), Search (magnifying glass), Notifications (bell), Analytics (chart), Multi-tenancy (building), Audit Log (clipboard), Localization (globe), Social Auth (users). Purple (#6c5ce7) icons on dark cards (#22222e). Title "10 Official Plugins" in white. Clean grid layout.

## Day 22 — Mobile Development with Jua

**Theme**: Feature

**Post Text**:

Building a mobile app backend usually means maintaining a separate codebase, duplicating validation logic, and hoping the API contract stays in sync.

Jua's mobile architecture mode generates both sides from one command:

```bash
jua new myapp
# Select: Mobile (API + React Native)
```

You get:

A Go API server:
- JWT authentication with mobile-optimized token refresh
- Push notification service (Firebase Cloud Messaging)
- Endpoints designed for mobile consumption (pagination, partial responses)
- Image optimization for mobile bandwidths

An Expo React Native app:
- TypeScript with generated API types from your Go backend
- Authentication flow (login, register, password reset)
- Secure token storage with expo-secure-store
- Pull-to-refresh, infinite scroll patterns
- Offline-first data caching

Shared between both:
- TypeScript type definitions generated from Go structs
- API client with automatic token refresh
- Validation rules used on both client and server

The type sharing is the key advantage. When you add a field to a Go struct, the TypeScript type updates on the next build. No manual sync. No out-of-date API documentation.

```go
// Go struct
type Product struct {
    ID    uint    `json:"id"`
    Name  string  `json:"name"`
    Price float64 `json:"price"`
}
```

```typescript
// Auto-generated TypeScript type
export interface Product {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    price: number;
}
```

Build your mobile backend and app together. Keep them in sync automatically.

https://juaframework.dev/courses/jua-mobile

**Gemini Image Prompt**: Create a professional LinkedIn post thumbnail (1200x627px) with a dark background (#0a0a0f). Show a phone mockup on the right displaying a mobile app with a list view and purple (#6c5ce7) accent colors. On the left, show a code editor with Go code. Arrows between them showing "Shared Types" in green (#00b894). Title "Mobile Apps with Go + React Native" in white. Expo and Go logos in the corners. Clean, split-view design.

## Day 23 — Security by Default with Sentinel WAF

**Theme**: Feature

**Post Text**:

Your application is live. Traffic is growing. And someone is probing your API endpoints at 3 AM.

Every Jua project includes Sentinel, a built-in Web Application Firewall that protects your application from common attacks.

What Sentinel handles:

Rate Limiting:
- Per-IP request throttling
- Per-endpoint rate limits (stricter on /auth/login)
- Configurable windows and thresholds

Brute-Force Protection:
- Account lockout after failed login attempts
- Progressive delays between attempts
- Automatic unlock after cooldown period

Request Validation:
- Maximum request body size enforcement
- Content-Type verification
- SQL injection pattern detection
- XSS payload filtering

Anomaly Detection:
- Unusual request patterns flagged
- Geographic anomaly alerts
- User-agent analysis
- Request frequency monitoring

IP Management:
- Whitelist trusted IPs
- Blacklist known bad actors
- Temporary bans with automatic expiry

All of this is configured, not coded. Adjust thresholds in your configuration file:

```yaml
sentinel:
  rate_limit:
    requests_per_minute: 60
    login_attempts: 5
    lockout_duration: 15m
  body_limit: 10mb
  blocked_countries: []
```

Most developers add security after an incident. Jua includes it before you write your first line of code.

Security should not be an afterthought. It should be a default.

https://juaframework.dev/docs/batteries/security

**Gemini Image Prompt**: Create a professional LinkedIn post thumbnail (1200x627px) with a dark background (#0a0a0f). Show a shield icon in the center with "Sentinel WAF" text, surrounded by icons representing different security features: clock (rate limiting), lock (brute-force), filter (request validation), radar (anomaly detection), list (IP management). Purple (#6c5ce7) shield with green (#00b894) feature icons. Title "Security by Default" in white. Red (#ff6b6b) blocked request indicators. Professional security-themed design.

## Day 24 — Code Snippet: Relationships

**Theme**: Code Snippet

**Post Text**:

Real applications have relationships between resources. Orders belong to users. Products have many categories. Students enroll in many courses.

Jua's code generator handles these out of the box:

belongs_to (one-to-many):
```bash
jua generate resource order \
  --fields "total:float,status:string,notes:text" \
  --belongs-to "user"
```

Generated Go model:
```go
type Order struct {
    ID        uint      `json:"id" gorm:"primaryKey"`
    Total     float64   `json:"total"`
    Status    string    `json:"status"`
    Notes     string    `json:"notes"`
    UserID    uint      `json:"user_id"`
    User      User      `json:"user" gorm:"foreignKey:UserID"`
    CreatedAt time.Time `json:"created_at"`
    UpdatedAt time.Time `json:"updated_at"`
}
```

many_to_many:
```bash
jua generate resource student \
  --fields "name:string,email:string,grade:int" \
  --many-to-many "courses"
```

Generated Go model:
```go
type Student struct {
    ID      uint      `json:"id" gorm:"primaryKey"`
    Name    string    `json:"name"`
    Email   string    `json:"email"`
    Grade   int       `json:"grade"`
    Courses []Course  `json:"courses" gorm:"many2many:student_courses;"`
}
```

The generator also creates:
- Migration with foreign keys and join tables
- Repository methods that eager-load relationships
- API endpoints that include or exclude related data
- Admin panel forms with relationship dropdowns
- TypeScript types reflecting the relationships

has_many:
```bash
jua generate resource category \
  --fields "name:string,slug:string" \
  --has-many "products"
```

Every relationship pattern in GORM is supported. The generated code handles eager loading, cascade deletes, and referential intejuay.

Stop writing relationship boilerplate by hand.

https://juaframework.dev/courses/jua-web/code-generator

**Gemini Image Prompt**: Create a professional LinkedIn post thumbnail (1200x627px) with a dark background (#0a0a0f). Show an entity relationship diagram with three tables (User, Order, Product) connected by relationship lines. Use purple (#6c5ce7) for table headers, white for field names, and green (#00b894) for relationship labels (belongs_to, has_many, many_to_many). Title "Generate Relationships, Not Boilerplate" in white. Clean database diagram style.

## Day 25 — Maintenance Mode

**Theme**: Quick Tip

**Post Text**:

Deploying a database migration that takes 30 seconds? Applying a critical hotfix? Need to take your application offline gracefully?

```bash
jua down
```

Your application enters maintenance mode. Every request receives a clean 503 response with a "We'll be right back" page. API requests get a JSON response:

```json
{
    "status": 503,
    "message": "Application is in maintenance mode",
    "retry_after": 300
}
```

Bring it back:

```bash
jua up
```

Instant. No restart required.

Allow specific IPs to bypass maintenance mode (so your team can test):

```bash
jua down --allow 192.168.1.100 --allow 10.0.0.50
```

Schedule maintenance with a custom message:

```bash
jua down --message "Upgrading database. Back in 10 minutes." --retry 600
```

If you have used Laravel, this will feel familiar. We took the same concept and brought it to Go.

The middleware checks a lightweight flag file. No database query. No Redis call. Zero performance impact during normal operation.

Small features that make production operations less stressful.

https://juaframework.dev/docs/concepts/cli

**Gemini Image Prompt**: Create a professional LinkedIn post thumbnail (1200x627px) with a dark background (#0a0a0f). Show a terminal with "jua down" command and a maintenance mode page mockup with a wrench icon in purple (#6c5ce7), "We'll be right back" message in white, and a subtle animated-style progress indicator. Split screen between terminal and browser. Title "Maintenance Mode in One Command" in white. Clean, operational-focused design.

## Day 29 — Convention Over Configuration

**Theme**: Philosophy

**Post Text**:

There are two schools of thought in framework design.

Configuration-first: Give developers maximum flexibility. Every behavior is configurable. Every default can be overridden. The framework makes no assumptions about how you want to structure your code.

Convention-first: Provide sensible defaults that work for most projects. Follow established patterns. Let developers override when they need to, but make the default path the easy path.

Jua follows the convention-first approach. Here is why.

When every project follows the same structure, something interesting happens:
- New team members understand the codebase on day one
- Code reviews focus on logic, not style
- Generators can create code that integrates perfectly
- Documentation applies to every project, not just the author's unique setup

Consider file organization. In a Jua project, you always know where to find things:

```
apps/api/
  internal/
    models/       — Database models
    repository/   — Data access layer
    services/     — Business logic
    handlers/     — HTTP handlers
    middleware/   — Request middleware
    config/       — Configuration
    routes/       — Route registration
```

There is nothing revolutionary about this structure. It is the standard Go project layout applied consistently.

The same principle applies everywhere:
- Authentication always uses JWT with the same token structure
- Validation always returns errors in the same format
- Pagination always uses the same query parameters
- File uploads always use presigned URLs

You can override any of these conventions. The generated code is yours. But the default path should not require decisions.

Frameworks that require 50 configuration choices before you start are not flexible. They are exhausting.

**Gemini Image Prompt**: Create a professional LinkedIn post thumbnail (1200x627px) with a dark background (#0a0a0f). Show two paths diverging: left path is chaotic with many branching arrows and question marks (in red #ff6b6b), labeled "Configuration-first". Right path is a clean straight line with checkmarks (in green #00b894), labeled "Convention-first". A signpost in the center with the Jua logo in purple (#6c5ce7). Title "Convention Over Configuration" in bold white. Philosophical, clean design.

## Day 30 — What's Next: Roadmap Preview

**Theme**: Future

**Post Text**:

Thirty days ago, we introduced Jua Framework. Today, we want to share where we are headed.

Here is a preview of the Jua roadmap for the coming months.

Plugin Marketplace:
A searchable registry where developers can publish and install community plugins. Think npm for Jua — browse, install, and integrate third-party functionality with one command. Quality standards and review process to maintain reliability.

Jua Cloud:
Managed hosting optimized for Jua applications. Push your code, we handle the infrastructure. Automatic scaling, database management, Redis provisioning, SSL, and monitoring. One `jua deploy --cloud` command.

New Architecture Modes:
- Microservices — Generate multiple Go services with shared infrastructure
- Monolith-first — Start as a monolith, split into services when ready
- Headless CMS — Content API with a pre-built content editor

Enhanced Code Generator:
- Generate from OpenAPI specs
- Import existing database schemas
- GraphQL endpoint generation
- gRPC service generation alongside REST

AI-Powered Development:
- Natural language resource generation ("create a blog with comments and tags")
- Intelligent code suggestions based on your project structure
- Automated test generation for new resources

Community Features:
- Template gallery for common project types (SaaS, e-commerce, CMS)
- Component marketplace for UI components
- Jua Certified program for production-tested plugins

We are building Jua for the long term. The foundation is solid. Now we are expanding what is possible.

Follow our LinkedIn page, star the GitHub repo, and subscribe on YouTube to stay updated as we ship these features.

The best full-stack Go framework is just getting started.

**Gemini Image Prompt**: Create a professional LinkedIn post thumbnail (1200x627px) with a dark background (#0a0a0f). Show a roadmap timeline flowing from left to right with milestone markers: "Plugin Marketplace", "Jua Cloud", "New Architectures", "Enhanced Generator", "AI Features". Each milestone has a small icon. The timeline line is purple (#6c5ce7) with green (#00b894) dots at each milestone. A rocket icon at the far right. Title "The Road Ahead" in bold white. Future-focused, aspirational design.

## Posting Guidelines

- **Best times**: Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10 AM in your target audience's timezone
- **Engagement**: Reply to every comment within 2 hours
- **Format**: Use line breaks for readability. LinkedIn truncates after ~3 lines, so make the first line compelling.
- **Images**: Generate thumbnails using the Gemini prompts provided. Upload as the post image for higher engagement.
- **Code blocks**: LinkedIn does not support markdown code blocks natively. For posts with code, consider creating a code screenshot image instead of inline code.
- **Hashtags**: Place at the end of the post, not inline.
